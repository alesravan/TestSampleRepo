# Data Driven in Testing

### C# inline datadriven
Data-driven unit testing in C# is a technique where you can run the same unit test with multiple sets of input data. This approach allows you to test different scenarios without duplicating code. There are multiple ways to achieve data-driven unit testing in C#, including using attributes, external files, or custom data sources.

Here's an example of how you can implement data-driven unit testing using the NUnit framework in C#:

1. Start by adding the NUnit package to your project. You can install it via NuGet.

2. Create a test class and method in your C# project using NUnit. In this example, we'll use the TestCase attribute to provide multiple sets of test data:

```csharp

using NUnit.Framework;

public class MyTestClass
{
    [TestCase(1, 2)]
    [TestCase(3, 6)]
    [TestCase(5, 10)]
    public void MyTestMethod(int input, int expectedOutput)
    {
        // Your test code here using the input and verifying against the expected output
        Assert.AreEqual(expectedOutput, YourMethodUnderTest(input));
    }

    private int YourMethodUnderTest(int input)
    {
        // Your implementation here
        return input * 2;
    }
}
```
In this example, the MyTestMethod is decorated with the TestCase attribute, and we provide different sets of input values and their corresponding expected output values.

3. Run the tests using your chosen test runner (such as NUnit Console Runner or Visual Studio's Test Explorer), and the test cases will be executed with the provided test data.
This approach is simple and effective for small sets of test data. However, when dealing with a large amount of test data or when you want to separate the test data from the test code, you can use external files or custom data sources, as explained in the previous response.

Remember to adapt the example to fit your specific needs and framework if you're using a different unit testing framework like MSTest.

### C# Data driven from External File
To perform data-driven unit testing in C# using external files, you can leverage frameworks like NUnit or MSTest and read the test data from files such as CSV, JSON, or Excel.

Here's an example of how you can achieve this using NUnit and a CSV file:

1. Add the NUnit and CsvHelper packages to your project. You can install them via NuGet.

2. Create a CSV file with your test data. For example, let's assume we have a file named "testdata.csv" with the following content:

```css 
Input,ExpectedOutput
1,2
3,6
5,10
```

3. Create a test class and method in your C# project using NUnit. In this example, we'll use the TestCaseSource attribute to read the test data from the CSV file:



```csharp
using NUnit.Framework;
using CsvHelper;
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
public class MyTestClass
{
    private static IEnumerable TestData()
    {
        using (var reader = new StreamReader("testdata.csv"))
        using (var csv = new CsvReader(reader))
        {
            csv.Configuration.HasHeaderRecord = true;
            csv.Read();
            csv.ReadHeader();

            while (csv.Read())
            {
                var input = csv.GetField<int>("Input");
                var expectedOutput = csv.GetField<int>("ExpectedOutput");
                yield return new object[] { input, expectedOutput };
            }
        }
    }

    [TestCaseSource(nameof(TestData))]
    public void MyTestMethod(int input, int expectedOutput)
    {
        // Your test code here using the input and verifying against the expected output
        Assert.AreEqual(expectedOutput, YourMethodUnderTest(input));
    }

    private int YourMethodUnderTest(int input)
    {
        // Your implementation here
        return input * 2;
    }
}
```

4. Run the tests using your chosen test runner (such as NUnit Console Runner or Visual Studio's Test Explorer), and the test cases will be executed using the data read from the CSV file.
This approach allows you to separate your test data from the test code, making it easier to maintain and update the test data as needed. You can also adapt this approach to read data from JSON, Excel, or other file formats by using the appropriate libraries and parsing techniques.

### Python Inline Datadriven

To write data-driven tests in Python, you can use parameterized testing frameworks such as pytest or unittest. These frameworks allow you to define test cases with different input data and expected outputs. Here's an example of how you can write data-driven tests using pytest:

1. Install the pytest package if it's not already installed:
```
pip install pytest
```

2. Import the necessary modules:

```python
import pytest
```

3. Define a test function and use the @pytest.mark.parametrize decorator to provide the test data:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("input_data, expected_output", [
    (2, 4),
    (3, 9),
    (5, 25),
])
def test_square(input_data, expected_output):
    result = square(input_data)
    assert result == expected_output
```
In this example, the test_square function is defined, and the @pytest.mark.parametrize decorator specifies the test data. Each set of test data is passed as arguments to the test function.

4. Implement the function or code under test:

```python
def square(num):
    return num ** 2
```
The square function calculates the square of a given number.

5. Run the tests using pytest from the command line:

```
pytest will automatically discover and execute the test functions.
```

When the tests run, each set of test data will be passed to the test function as separate test cases. Assertions can be used to validate the expected output against the actual result.

Note: If you're using the unittest framework, a similar approach can be applied using the @unittest.data-driven decorator or by subclassing unittest.TestCase and defining test methods with different input data using self.assert* methods.

By using data-driven testing, you can write concise and reusable test cases that cover various scenarios and inputs, helping to improve test coverage and maintainability.

### Python Datadriven from External file

To perform data-driven testing in pytest using data from an external file, you can use various methods to read the data and pass it to the test function. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

1. Create a data file (e.g., a CSV or JSON file) with the test data. Let's assume you have a CSV file named "testdata.csv" with the following structure:
```
input_data,expected_output
2,4
3,9
5,25
```
2. Install the necessary packages if they are not already installed. In this example, we will use the pytest-csv package to read data from the CSV file:

```
pip install pytest pytest-csv
```

3. Create a test file (e.g., "test_data_driven.py") and import the necessary modules:

```python
import pytest
import csv
```

4. Define a function to read the test data from the CSV file:

```python
def read_test_data(file_path):
    test_data = []
    with open(file_path, "r") as file:
        reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        for row in reader:
            test_data.append(row)
    return test_data
```
5. Use the @pytest.mark.parametrize decorator and the test data from the external file to create data-driven tests:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("test_input", read_test_data("testdata.csv"))
def test_square(test_input):
    input_data = int(test_input['input_data'])
    expected_output = int(test_input['expected_output'])

    result = square(input_data)
    assert result == expected_output
```
6. Implement the function or code under test:

```python
def square(num):
    return num ** 2
```
7. Run the tests using pytest from the command line:

```
pytest
```
The read_test_data function reads the data from the CSV file and returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a test case with the input data and expected output. The @pytest.mark.parametrize decorator uses this test data to generate individual test cases for the test_square function.

By running pytest, the tests will be executed with each set of test data, and assertions will validate the expected output against the actual result.

You can modify the read_test_data function based on the structure and format of your external data file (e.g., JSON, XML). Additionally, you can use different packages or methods to read the data, depending on your requirements.
